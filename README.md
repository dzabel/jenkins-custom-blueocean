# Customized Blueocean Theme

This is a seed project to quickly create a jenkins-ci new ux plugin.
It comes with storybook and the [storybook-specification](https://github.com/mthuret/storybook-addon-specifications) plugins already setup.
To make make it even easier to use it has Docker support to see the storybook server.

# Install

After cloning the repository you need to fist build the project.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

The above will as well do a `npm install`. Please make sure that you have build the project before e.g. running with Docker.

# Run

## jenkins

When you first run the plugin via `hpi:run`, you will need to follow the instructions to setup the newly created Jenkins.
However the next time you run the command it will be much faster.

```bash
mvn hpi:run
```

This will start a full jenkins around your plugin.

## storybook

To demonstrate and simulate quickly different use-cases of our components we use [storybook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kadira/storybook).

We further use storybook to implement unit testing and cover the acceptance criteria with them.
